This is a Sprite Designer I am writing for the BASIC Engine hobby computer
https://basicengine.org/
It allows one to create 32x32 "sprites" saved both in the .pcx image format or 
as DATA statements with contain the color code of each pixel meant to be READ
as a loop and PSET into a 32x32 area of the screen ideally to be acted upon
by blit techniques.  While the .pcx file can be acted upon as a sprite or 
background as a "bitmap".

You must update your BASIC Engine with the encluded firmware "unnoficialver395.bin"
before Sprite Designer will work.  This firmware's updates should be incorporated into the next
official firmware update at https://github.com/uli/basicengine-firmware

The main program starts with a short instruction screen.
Controls:
  Arrow Keys/PSX controller
  z=plot pixel
  x=del pixel
  s=save
  a=load
  p=erase and start over
  d=save "sprite" as data statements
  
  Palette picker:
  Base Color Controls:            Sub Color Controls:
    7=up                            9=up
    1=down                          3=down
    4=choose color                  6=choose color
    
The save and load commands automatically append either .pcx or .spr accordingly.    
  
spriteloader.bas   Is intended as an example routine to plot the "sprite" saved
as data statements onto the screen.
This workflow is as follows:
  1. create sprite and save it with 'd' as data statements file ending in .spr
  2. LOAD "spriteloader.bas"
  3. MERGE "your-sprite-name.spr"
  4. RUN
  
Since the DATA statements file starts with line number 5000 it will certainly merge
without problems with just about any base program.

Please enjoy and give me feedback and idea.
